## Agile Meetup
March 27, 2017

### 1 & 2
- As an Agile Coach, what does a Technical coach want me to know? What am I (are we) missing?
  - You don't need to know how to do everything, but you need to know what it looks like when it's being done wrong.
  - "When I see [this behavior], what questions should I ask?"
    - Ask about technical debt, bug detection...what else?
  - Agile sprints but having a long time before something is in production
- Can a non technical person be good at categories 1 and 2?


### 3 - Educating Individuals and Groups
- Developers/Q&A
- Project Owners
- Executives
  - Different needs, involved in a very different part of the process
  - The decision about what to do next, and if it's the right thing
  - Thinking about marketshare, revenue gains or losses
  - Looking for low hanging fruit; high value but inexpensive
  - **When given a feature requirement, ask directly for a metric to measure if project is going in the right direction.** If gathering the information requires additional investment, that needs to be taken into account.
  - Be sure that people who are allocating large amounts of money are asking the right questions.
  - Be comfortable coaching leadership, not fearful. They're paying you to tell them the truth.

### 4 - Process Underpinning
For Scrum dictated ceremonies, how comfortable are you talking about "why" and expected outcomes?

- Daily Standup/Daily Planning
  - "What are we going to do today?"
  - "Who am I going to pair up with today?"
- Release planning/Road-mapping, high level
- Backlog Grooming
- Estimating
- Sprint planning
- Sprint review/demo
  - Have product owner do demo for the team ideally
  - Speak their language, discuss the value as it pertains to the audience
- Retrospectives
  - Things that frequently go right/wrong rely on:
    - Trust - "Safety is not something that you can detect by its presence, but by its absence"
    - Level of routine/newness
    - All talk, no action
